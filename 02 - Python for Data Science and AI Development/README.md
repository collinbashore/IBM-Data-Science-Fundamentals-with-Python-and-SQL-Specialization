## About this Course
This course covers the basics of Python Programming fundamentals, including data structures, and data analysis, through complete hands-on exercises through the course modules, which prepares you to create a final project in the Python Project for Data Science course.

## Labs/Exercises
This section of the course includes all of the completed hands-on lab exercises
for each week of course as follows:

- **Week 1:** [Python Basics](https://github.com/collinbashore/IBM-Data-Science-Fundamentals-with-Python-and-SQL-Specialization/tree/main/02%20-%20Python%20for%20Data%20Science%20and%20AI%20Development/Week%201%20Labs)
  - This module teaches the basics of Python and begins by exploring some of the different data types such as integers, real numbers, and strings
  - Other topics covered in this module are how to use expressions in mathematical operations, store values in variables, and the many different ways to manipulate strings
- **Week 2:** [Python Data Structures](https://github.com/collinbashore/IBM-Data-Science-Fundamentals-with-Python-and-SQL-Specialization/tree/main/02%20-%20Python%20for%20Data%20Science%20and%20AI%20Development/Week%202%20Labs)
  - Data Structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are how each one can store collections of data and how they are ordered.
- **Week 3:** [Python Programming Fundamentals](https://github.com/collinbashore/IBM-Data-Science-Fundamentals-with-Python-and-SQL-Specialization/tree/main/02%20-%20Python%20for%20Data%20Science%20and%20AI%20Development/Week%203%20Labs)
  - This module begins with the concepts of conditions and branching
  - Other topics covered are how to implement loops to iterate over sequences (for and while loops), create functions to perform a specific task, exception error handling to catch errors, and how classes are needed to create objects.
- **Week 4:** [Working with Data in Python](https://github.com/collinbashore/IBM-Data-Science-Fundamentals-with-Python-and-SQL-Specialization/tree/main/02%20-%20Python%20for%20Data%20Science%20and%20AI%20Development/Week%204%20Labs)
  - This module begins with learning how to read and write files
  - Uncovers the best Python libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas, that will aid in data manipulation and mathematical operations.
- **Week 5:** [APIs, Web Scraping, and Data Collection](https://github.com/collinbashore/IBM-Data-Science-Fundamentals-with-Python-and-SQL-Specialization/tree/main/02%20-%20Python%20for%20Data%20Science%20and%20AI%20Development/Week%205%20Labs)
  - This module covers the unique ways to collect data by the use of APIs and Webscraping.
  - It also covers the ways on how to collect data when dealing with different file formats
